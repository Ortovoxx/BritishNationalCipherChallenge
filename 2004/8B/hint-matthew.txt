If my data is correct, there are four different key configurations that give a coherent message over the first 36 characters (which is, in fact, the correct start of the message). Given that you say 36 and not a slightly higher number, I suspect that you've got one of the wrong ones, but even the right one gets hard to read around this patch.

Like the Wombats suggest, you should go through the first 60-65 characters before you utterly reject a trial, especially if you can awkwardly pronounce the plaintext stream you're generating.
