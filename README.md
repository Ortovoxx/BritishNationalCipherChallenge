# British National Cipher Challenge

This is an unofficial archive of the British National Cipher Challenge
(https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). The purpose is to collect all parts
of the challenges in one place and to preserve them before they are lost
to bit rot and server decay. The official site only goes back two years, and
archive.org and other sites are also incomplete.

Stuff in this archive is copyright University of Southampton.

All ciphertexts and plaintexts are present, and all ciphers have been identified.

Some data are missing that are necessary for anyone who wants to attempt the
challenges. We know that, and we're sorry. Here is a list of the missing bits.
If you have any of them, please upload in the "issues" section.

- 2005 part 8B: the original wiring diagrams or photos needed to reconstruct the machine
                (FialkaSettings.pdf)
- 2006 part 7B: the PDF reconciling the literal decryption with the original plaintext
                (Solution7text.pdf)
- 2010 part 8B: photo of the "first half" of the deck of cards (we have the final photo
                that reveals the solution)
- 2015 part 8B: the original photo of the deck (we have one after two more cards were added,
                and have a reconstruction of the original)

Other bits we wish we had:

- 2010 part 8B: Jokers.pdf ("Harry's Jokers"), a file of the playing cards
- 2010 Harry's Game: all ciphertexts
- 2012 Harry's Game (following the 2011 competition): any ciphertexts after 2B

For those who care about such things, these posters are missing:

- 2002 poster
- 2016 full-sized poster
