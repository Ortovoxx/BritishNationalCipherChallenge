# British National Cipher Challenge

This is an unofficial archive of the British National Cipher Challenge
(https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). The purpose is to collect all parts
of the challenges in one place and to preserve them before they are lost
to bit rot and server decay. The official site only goes back three years, and
archive.org and other sites are also incomplete. Preserving them allows
competitors (or anyone else who is interested) to use them as practice.

The official site:

    2016.cipherchallenge.org
    2017.cipherchallenge.org
    2018.cipherchallenge.org
    www.cipherchallenge.org [current year]

Stuff in this archive is copyright University of Southampton (except for the
identification of ciphers and keys ("solution.txt" for each challenge) and any
scripts or programs in this archive).

All ciphertexts and plaintexts are present, and all ciphers and keys have been
identified. All information that was given when each challenge began is present,
so you can do the challenges for yourself.

Other bits we wish we had:

- 2001 official hints
- 2002 some of the GIFs of the texts: plaintexts 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15; ciphertext 13
- 2003 some of the GIFs of the texts: plaintexts 3, 4, 5, 8; ciphertexts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- 2005 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have a few)
- 2005 part 8B: The second (clear) photo of rotor 2
- 2006 GIFs of the ciphertexts
- 2006 part 7B: the PDF reconciling the literal decryption with the original plaintext
                (Solution7text.pdf)
- 2007 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 0A and 0B and plaintexts for 8A and 8B)
- 2008 parts 1A and 1B from the challenges that appeared in the forum
- 2008 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B plaintexts)
- 2009 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B)
- 2010 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B)
- 2010 part 8B "teaser" that was released before the challenge was posted
- 2010 part 8B: Jokers.pdf ("Harry's Jokers"), a file of the playing cards
- 2010 Harry's Game: all ciphertexts
- 2012 Harry's Game (following the 2011 competition): any ciphertexts after 2B
- 2015 part 8B: remaining hints (images of the deck with more cards showing)
- 2017 images of ciphertexts for 4A through 8B
- 2018 images of ciphertexts for 2A through 10B
- any other years of Harry's Game
- the official keywords for the transposition ciphers. I won't list them here, so no spoilers.
- any official hints that we have not found yet

For those who care about such things, these posters and graphics are missing:

- 2002 poster
- 2006 desktop wallpapers (3 images in various sizes)
