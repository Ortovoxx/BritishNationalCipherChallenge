# British National Cipher Challenge

This is an unofficial archive of the British National Cipher Challenge
(https://www.cipherchallenge.org/). The purpose is to collect all parts
of the challenges in one place and to preserve them before they are lost
to bit rot and server decay. The official site only goes back two years, and
archive.org and other sites are also incomplete. Preserving them allows
competitors (or anyone else who is interested) to use them as practice.

Stuff in this archive is copyright University of Southampton (except for the
identification of ciphers and keys ("solution.txt" for each challenge) and any
scripts or programs in this archive).

All ciphertexts and plaintexts are present, and all ciphers and keys have been identified.

Some data are missing that are necessary for anyone who wants to attempt the
challenges. We know that, and we're sorry. Here is a list of the missing bits.
If you have any of them, please upload in the "issues" section.

- 2005 part 8B: the original wiring diagrams or photos needed to reconstruct the machine
                (FialkaSettings.pdf)
- 2006 part 7B: the PDF reconciling the literal decryption with the original plaintext
                (Solution7text.pdf)
- 2010 part 8B: photo of the "first half" of the deck of cards (we have the final photo
                that reveals the solution)
- 2015 part 8B: the original photo of the deck (we have one after two more cards were added,
                and have a reconstruction of the original)

Other bits we wish we had:

- 2001 official hints
- 2002 GIFs of the texts (we know they exist)
- 2003 GIFS of the texts (we know they exist)
- 2005 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have a few)
- 2006 GIFs of the ciphertexts
- 2007 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 0A and 0B and plaintexts for 8A and 8B)
- 2008 parts 1A and 1B from the challenges that appeared in the forum
- 2008 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B plaintexts)
- 2009 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B)
- 2010 GIFs of the ciphertexts and plaintexts (we only have 8A and 8B)
- 2010 part 8B: Jokers.pdf ("Harry's Jokers"), a file of the playing cards
- 2010 Harry's Game: all ciphertexts
- 2012 Harry's Game (following the 2011 competition): any ciphertexts after 2B
- any other years of Harry's Game
- the official keywords for the transposition ciphers. I won't list them here, so no spoilers.
- any official hints that we have not found yet

For those who care about such things, these posters and graphics are missing:

- 2002 poster
- 2006 desktop wallpapers (3 images in various sizes)
- 2016 full-sized poster
