Can be viewed as a periodic substitution cipher (sliced like a Vigenere cipher,
where each slice is encrypted with a general substitution cipher)
    period = 7
    keys:
        DceOfgiAjklmnpWqrtHuvxbyzS
        tyzuSHArDOWbcevfgiqjklxmnp
        WfgbijkOlmnpqrctuvDxyzeSHA

Harry calls the cipher a "keyed Vigenere cipher".
This works if the Vigenere key is ARCHIVE and the alphabet is
SHADOWBCEFGIJKLMNPQRTUVXYZ, so that the two keywords are
SHADOW and ARCHIVE. Note that we must take A=1, B=2, ...,
instead of what we usually do (A=0, B=1, ...).
