Sometimes the titles of the challenges are clues to solving them.
So here are the titles for 2002:

    1 The story begins
    2 The mysterious stranger
    3 Secrecy is the key
    4 The fiendish French
    5 The flight to Southampton
    6 Mon Dieu!
    7 A visionary approach
    8 A breakthrough?
    9 Hot on the trail
    10 Hope dawns
    11 Monumental disaster?
    12 Trouble brewing
    13 Disturbing developments
    14 A fragment of hope
    15 All becomes clear
    16 The final challenge
