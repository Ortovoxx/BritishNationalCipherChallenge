I call this a "periodic affine cipher". Like Vigenere, it is cut into slices, but each
slice undergoes an affine substitution rather than a Caesar shift. All of the affine
substitutions share the same multiplier, but they have different offsets. The offsets
spell a key phrase.

multiplier = 7
key phrase (offsets) = AGRICOLAE MORTEM

(Why is it in the accusative case?)

Harry says it's an affine cipher, followed by Vigenere. So decrypt in the reverse order:
Vigenere with key AGRICOLAE MORTEM, then affine with multiplier 7 and offset 0.

It is also a type 2 polyalphabetic substitution cipher (Quagmire II) with alphabet key
AHOVCJQXELSZGNUBIPWDKRYFMT (from the affine part) and shift key
AGRICOLAE MORTEM (from the Vigenere part).
