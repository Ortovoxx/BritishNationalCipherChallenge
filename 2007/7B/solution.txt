In each pair of letters, the first is unaltered, but the second is shifted
by the amount of the first, where A=1,...,Z=26, with wrapping around the alphabet.

Or, you can think of the cipher as a Vigenere followed by a 2x2 Hill cipher.
The Vigenere key is AB, and the Hill matrix is

    B A  =  1 0
    B B     1 1

To decipher, reverse the order of the Hill and Vigenere ciphers.
